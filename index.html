					<h2>What is My Summer Car?</h2><br>
					<p>My Summer Car is a survival and car building simulator released by Johannes Rojola and Kaarina Pönkkä in October 2016. The game is set in rural Finland during the spring-summer of 1995, where the 19 year-old player character lives alone while his parents are on vacation. The player has to survive, assemble and restore his father's broken-down Satsuma AMP (based on the Datsun 100A), using the parts found in the garage and scattered on the map.</p>
					<p>After restoring the car to a functional state and passing the inspection, the purpose shifts towards upgrading the car with performance parts to participate in the weekly rally and, eventually, win the 1st prize.</p>

					<h2>How hard is My Summer Car?</h2>
					<p>In general, surviving is the easiest aspect. As long as you work and drive carefully, there should be no shortage of food and beer in your fridge. Building the car is a bit harder, but that's what this guide is for. The hardest aspect of the game is winning the rally (especially if you're using a keyboard instead of a steering wheel), since you're expected to drive extremely fast on narrow roads while avoiding the <strike>poorly</strike> <i>creatively</i> programmed AI.</p>

					<h2>Should I use the experimental build?</h2>
					<p>Absolutely. The experimental build is just as glitchy as the rest of the game, however it has more content - it's worth it. As of now, the password for joining the experimental build is dingdongpong. To join, right-click the game on Steam, go to Properties, then Betas, then input the password and select the experimental build.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Should I use mods?</h2>
					<p>Again, absolutely! Many mods serve to make your life a whole lot easier in the game. For more details check the Mods page.</p>
