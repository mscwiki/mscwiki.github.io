			<h2>What is My Summer Car?</h2><br>
			<p> My Summer Car is a survival and car building simulator released by Johannes Rojola and Kaarina Pönkkä in October 2016. The game is set in rural Finland during the spring-summer of 1995, where the 19 year-old player character lives alone while his parents are on vacation. The player has to survive, assemble and restore his father's broken-down Satsuma AMP (based on the Datsun 100A), using the parts found in the garage and scattered on the map.</p>
