					<h2>What is My Summer Car?</h2><br>
					<p>My Summer Car is a survival and car building simulator released by Johannes Rojola and Kaarina Pönkkä in October 2016. The game is set in rural Finland during the spring-summer of 1995, where the 19 year-old player character lives alone while his parents are on vacation. The player has to survive, assemble and restore his father's broken-down Satsuma AMP (based on the Datsun 100A), using the parts found in the garage and scattered on the map.</p>
					<p>After restoring the car to a functional state and passing the inspection, the purpose shifts towards upgrading the car with performance parts to participate in the weekly rally and, eventually, win the 1st prize.</p>

					<h2>How hard is My Summer Car?</h2>
					<p>In general, surviving is the easiest aspect. As long as you work and drive carefully, there should be no shortage of food and beer in your fridge. Building the car is a bit harder, but, hey, that's what this guide is for. The hardest aspect of the game is winning the rally, as the roads are incredibly narrow and twist like crazy, not to mention the other competitors don't exactly care about your (or their own) wellbeing.</p>

					<h2>Should I use the experimental build?</h2>
					<p>Absolutely. The experimental build is just as glitchy as the rest of the game, however it has more content - it's worth it. As of now, the password for joining the experimental build is dingdongpong. To join, right-click the game on Steam, go to Properties, then Betas, then input the password and select the experimental build.</p>

				<div>
					<h2>Should I use mods?</h2>
					<p>Again, absolutely! Many mods serve to make your life a whole lot easier in the game. For more details check the Mods page.</p>
