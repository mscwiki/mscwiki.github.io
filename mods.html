				<h1>Mods!</h1>
				<h5>and other recommended utilities...</h5>
				<p>These mods (at least most of them) serve to enhance your gameplay experience. (This is not a complete list of mods for My Summer Car, these are the mods I recommend having because they improve the game without adding any new content)</p>
				<div>
					<h2>Modern Optimization Plugin (MOP)</h2>
					<figure style="text-align:center">

					<p>Probably the most important mod here, MOP increases FPS by unloading some unnecessary files while you're playing. This will lead to noticeable FPS boosts and will improve your experience, as you won't be frustrated anymore when your 2020 gaming rig can't run a Unity game at 60 FPS.</p>
					<a class="mod" href="https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/mop-modern-optimization-plugin.30073/">You can get the mod by clicking here!</a>

					<h2>Radio Subtitles</h2>
					<figure style="text-align:center;">
						<img src="images/sub.png" height="150" width="700">

					<p>Another mod that drastically improves your experience, Radio Subtitles helps you understand the radio better if you don't speak Finnish. I consider this mod important because a lot of the humour in the game is broadcast on the radio; you'll feel much better playing the game when radio shows aren't senseless noise anymore.</p>
