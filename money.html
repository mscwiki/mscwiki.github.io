					<h2>Firewood Delivery</h2>
					<p>This method is perhaps the safest option out of all the others, and it also yields a nice profit - 3200mk if done right.</p>
					<p>Park the trailer in the shed and start chopping logs. If you can't put logs on the chopping block anymore, make sure there's nothing else there, such as a bit of firewood that's sitting on it. Keep loading firewood into the trailer until the pile stops growing (or just count 81 logs chopped but it's much easier to just pay attention to the pile). Once it's loaded drive the tractor and trailer to the client's house (shown on the map, or just take two lefts and stop at the second house on the right). If someone is waiting for you there, then you can drop the firewood safely (if there's nobody there just go back home and make sure there's a dart on the house that you just went to; don't drop the wood, because there's nobody to pay you!).</p>
					<p>You can lift the trailer by using the Rear Hydraulics switch while the hand throttle is on. To lower the trailer, just put the Rear Hydraulics switch back to its original position (while still having the hand throttle engaged).</p>
					<h3 style="color:lime;">Profit: 3200mk (minus the cost of diesel/fuel oil but that's cheap).

					<h2>Home-brewed Beverages</h2>
					<p>Another low-risk, high-reward job that only needs you to start it!</p>
					<p>Start by taking the boat out to the cottage on the island. Once there, enter the sauna (room on the right) and pick up the bucket (while you're on the island you may also want to pick up the coffee cup and kettle). Once back home with the bucket, put it under the tap in the bathroom and let it fill up. Once it's filled, put in exactly 6 sugar packets and 1 yeast packet, then close the lid. You should now hear some bubbles once in a while. While waiting for the fermentation to finish (will take a few days), go to Teimo's and buy all the juice concentrate bottles you can find (you will need 20). Drink them when you get back home. Once the bubbling has stopped, remove the lid and fill up the bottles by holding them inside the bucket until you hear a "slosh" sound.</p>
					<p>Now you have kilju, a Finnish homemade alcoholic drink popular in the 90s. Time to sell it. Load up the bottles in a vehicle and drive to the drunk's house (go the same way you would have gone while delivering firewood but this time stop at the third house (it's on the left)). If you can sell him kilju, he should be sitting at a table in the front yard. Drop a bottle on the table, and he will taste it. Depending on whether you've been following the correct recipe, he will comment on the kilju's quality. What you want to hear is "Very good sugar wine! I love this, strong as hell! I pay well for this.". Once he has said this, leave the rest of the bottles on the table and take the money that he's holding.</p>
					<h3 style="color:lime";>Profit: 3400mk - 259mk (cost of bottles) - 8.95mk (cost of yeast) - 41.7mk (cost of sugar) = 3090.35mk (fuel is not included as again, it's cheap).</p>
