					<h1>How to Get Money, the Smart Way<h1>
					<h3>Do you need some more money for that upgrade you've been looking at? Need to get your car fixed? This guide will explain how to get the most money in the shortest amount of time.</h3>

					<p>This method is perhaps the safest option out of all the others, and it also yields a nice profit - 3200mk if done right.</p>
					<p>Park the trailer in the shed and start chopping logs. If you can't put logs on the chopping block anymore, make sure there's nothing else there, such as a bit of firewood that's sitting on it. Keep loading firewood into the trailer until the pile stops growing (or just count 81 logs chopped but it's much easier to just pay attention to the pile). Once it's loaded drive the tractor and trailer to the client's house (shown on the map, or just take two lefts and stop at the second house on the right). If someone is waiting for you there, then you can drop the firewood safely (if there's nobody there just go back home and make sure there's a dart on the house that you just went to; don't drop the wood, because there's nobody to pay you!).</p>
					<p>You can lift the trailer by using the Rear Hydraulics switch while the hand throttle is on. To lower the trailer, just put the Rear Hydraulics switch back to its original position (while still having the hand throttle engaged).</p>
					<h3 style="color:lime;">Profit: 3200mk (minus the cost of diesel/fuel oil but that's cheap)</h3>

					<p>Another low-risk, high-reward job that completes itself, allowing you to work on something else!</p>
					<p>Start by taking the boat out to the cottage on the island. Once there, enter the sauna (room on the right) and pick up the bucket (while you're on the island you may also want to pick up the coffee cup and kettle). Once back home with the bucket, put it under the tap in the bathroom and let it fill up. Once it's filled, put in exactly 6 sugar packets and 1 yeast packet, then close the lid. You should now hear some bubbles once in a while. While waiting for the fermentation to finish (will take a few days), go to Teimo's and buy all the juice concentrate bottles you can find (you will need 20). Drink them when you get back home. Once the bubbling has stopped, remove the lid and fill up the bottles by holding them inside the bucket until you hear a "slosh" sound.</p>
					<p>Now you have kilju, a Finnish homemade alcoholic drink popular in the 90s. Time to sell it. Load up the bottles in a vehicle and drive to the drunk's house (go the same way you would have gone while delivering firewood but this time stop at the third house (it's on the left)). If you can sell him kilju, he should be sitting at a table in the front yard. Drop a bottle on the table, and he will taste it. Depending on whether you've been following the correct recipe, he will comment on the kilju's quality. What you want to hear is "Very good sugar wine! I love this, strong as hell! I pay well for this.". Once he has said this, leave the rest of the bottles on the table and take the money that he's holding.</p>
					<h3 style="color:lime;">Profit: 3400mk - 259mk (cost of bottles) - 8.95mk (cost of yeast) - 41.7mk (cost of sugar) = 3090.35mk (fuel is not included as again, it's cheap).</p>

					<h2 style="color:yellow;">Emptying Septic Tanks</h2>
					<figure style="text-align:center;">
						<img src="paska.png" alt="shit sucker" height="460" width="700">
						<figcaption>Tanker at work</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>This job doesn't pay as much, and is a little less safer, although the payout is nothing to scoff at.<p>
					<p>Look at the map and note where you have to go to empty the septic tanks. Once there, park with your rear as close as possible to the manhole. Remove the lid, and click on the hose to drag it out. Once the hose is completely inside the well, go inside the cab of the tanker, turn on the hydraulic pumps (switch on the right) and engage the hand throttle (stick on the left of the dashboard) (you can tell that the pumping has started when you hear a lot of coughing and swearing). The more the hand throttle is pulled, the faster the tanker will work. Once done, the person near the well (usually sitting on a chair in front of their house) will offer you 1200mk. Make sure to take it. Do this with every other house that has a full tank (you can tell that the tank is full if someone is waiting in front of the house).</p>
					<p>Once done, drive to the waste management plant in Peräjärvi (open between 8 and 16 on working days) and pay the worker there to open the gates (costs vary depending on how much sewage you have). After paying, drive the tanker's rear inside through the gates and open the valve at the rear. Wait there until the sewage stops, and then close the valve before leaving.</p>
					<h3 style="color:lime;">Profit: 1200mk * how many tanks you've emptied - 150mk (starting price for dumping sewage) - 0.14mk/litre (price of dumping one litre of sewage) - price of fuel (you'll be using a lot, the tanker isn't efficient)
					<h3 style="color:crimson;">Risks: death, the usual (falling into a septic tank)</h3>

					<h2 style="color:yellow;">Advert Delivery</h2>
					<p>Teimo can ask you to deliver his adverts to every postbox you see, and the payout is proportional to how many flyers you drop off.</p>
					<p>Try to drive in something with good fuel efficiency and (relatively) good safety, such as the Satsuma, Hayosiko or the moped. To drop off an advert, press F on the pile Teimo gives you, pick up the advert and place it in a mailbox (it will open and close automatically).</p>
					<p>In total there are 27 mailboxes:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Graveyard: 5 mailboxes</li>
						<li>Apartments: 7 mailboxes (the blank ones count too!)</li>
						<li>House near the school: 1 mailbox</li>
						<li>Teimo's house: 1 mailbox</li>
						<li>House SW of the radio tower: 1 mailbox</li>
						<li>Ventti shack near the lake: 1 mailbox</li>
						<li>Loppe: 4 mailboxes</li>
						<li>Jokke's house: 1 mailbox</li>
						<li>Firewood man's house: 1 mailbox</li>
						<li>Home: 1 mailbox (yours doesn't count!)</li>
						<li>Grandma's house: 1 mailbox</li>
						<li>Strawberry field: 2 mailboxes</li>
					</ol>
					<h3 style="color:lime;">Profit: 25mk * number of delivered advertisements = maximum of 675mk<h3>
