					<h1>Starting A New Game</h1>
					<h3>Starting anew can be difficult at first, because of a severe food and money shortage. Luckily, constructing the car is pretty simple if you have a guide.</h2><br><br>

					<h2>Making Sure You're Not Wasting Time</h2>
					<p>First of all, head into the garage (open doors with right-click and left-click), grab the driver's seat, carry it over to the car, and shake it around inside until a check mark pops up. Left-click to mount the seat. Then, take the spanner set from the garage and open it (F). Once it's open, enter Tool Mode (2) and pick up the 9mm spanner. Rotate the scroll wheel upwards on all four screws (not all of them are visible, think of where they would be) and make sure to tighten them completely.</p>
					<p><br>Why do this? Your uncle, who owns a van and a septic tanker, won't show up unless your seat is fitted, your suspension is assembled, or your engine is mounted. Of course, fitting the seat is the easiest task of the three. Now, your uncle should show up if you wait a few days, meanwhile, it's time to visit the closest town to buy what you need to finish the car. You need Uncle to spawn so you can borrow the van and later, the septic tanker. The van is great for carrying shopping and upgrades, and the septic tanker is one of your main sources of income.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>I recommend doing some jobs before starting to build the car, such as chopping wood and waiting for the delivery request. The extra money helps a lot.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Gone Shopping</h2>
					<p>Before leaving, go to the parts catalog in the garage and buy the cheapest set of rims. Take the envelope with you. Head over to the boat that's at the dock, taking the beer case and the gas can (green) with you (and the sausages if you're hungry). Once in the boat, start it by pulling the motor pull cord until you hear the engine running. Switch into the first gear and head towards the small island in the middle of the lake. There, pick up the bucket (with its lid) and get back in the boat. Keep going in the direction you were originally headed (you should also be able to see a church tower now, go towards that). Congratulations, you are now in Peräjärvi! Find the store and buy the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Some sausages</li>
						<li>One coolant bottle</li>
						<li>One motor oil bottle</li>
						<li>Three clutch/brake fluid bottles (at least)</li>
						<li>One fan belt</li>
						<li>Some mosquito spray</li>
						<li>Sparkplug box</li>
						<li>New battery</li>
						<li>New oil filter</li>
						<li>Fill up the gas can</li>
					<ul>
					<p>Don't forget to leave the envelope in the mailbox when heading back! Also, this will be tedious, as you'll have to make 4 round trips to bring everything to the boat.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>Engine and Chassis</h2>
					<p>Once home, start by finding the engine block in the garage and placing it somewhere accessible, such as the garage floor or table.<p>
					<p>Then, attach the following parts (if something is marked !, then there is an exception, check the exceptions list at the bottom before tightening the marked part):</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Crankshaft to block</li>
						<li>3 main bearings (2x7 each)</li>

					</ol>
					<p>Congratulations! Your engine is now complete, but your job is not complete yet. You still have to assemble the chassis.</p>
					<p>Now you have to get creative and find a way to push the car inside the garage so you can work underneath it.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Sub frame (4x10)</li>
						<li>Steering rack (4x9)</li>
						<li>Steering column (2x8)</li>

						<li>2 halfshafts (3x9 each)</li>
						<li>2 struts (!)(4x9 each, 3x10 each, 1x12 each)</li>
						<li>Adjust the steering rods by fully untightening the bolt (up to 120 ticks!) and then retighening the bolt exactly 60 ticks</li>
						<li>2 trail arms (2x12 each)</li>
						<li>2 coil springs</li>
						<li>2 drum brakes (1x14 each)</li>
						<li>Wheels (4x13)</li>

					</ol>
					<p>This is the exception list for bolts.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Camshaft gear must be aligned with the crankshaft (there is a small notch/arrow on the camshaft gear that should be pointed towards the crankshaft)</li>
						<li>Place alternator belt on alternator before tightening alternator. Tighten 7mm and 10mm bolt, then scroll the mousewheel on the alternator until it is touching the belt, then tighten the screw.</li>
						<li>Gearbox shares all 7mm bolts with inspection cover, install both before tightening</li>
						<li>Steering rods share their 12mm bolt with struts, install both before tightening</li>
						<li>Disk brakes share their 14mm bolt with halfshafts, install both before tightening</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Now, your engine is fitted, but you're still not done. These are the last components you need to assemble (then comes tuning).</p>

					<p>Done! Those lists were long, weren't they? Now, fill up the car's fluids (gas into... you know where gas goes, oil into rocker cover, coolant into radiator, clutch/brake fluid into the three caps on the engine bay's corner), pull back the engine choke (inside the car), hold the ignition switch down, and, once it starts, rev the car a little and push the choke back in. If it doesn't stop abruptly, congratulations! You have a functional car!</p>

					<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
					<p>Now that your car works, it's time to drive to the inspection shop in order to get your car inspected. You can either take the normal highway route into town and risk getting stopped at a police checkpoint, or take the longer dirt road.<br><br> Whichever route you take, once you're in town, park your car on the lift inside the inspection shop and pay poor Lindell to use his magic screwdriver to check your car. If you followed these steps, you should now have in front of you two new beautiful license plates, which you should now fit onto your bumpers.</p>
